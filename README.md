Simple C/C++ preprocessor

This is a simple C/C++ preprocessor.

To see how you can use simplecpp in your project, you can look at the file main.cpp.

Simplecpp has better fidelity than normal C/C++ preprocessors.
 * Preprocessor directives are available.
 * Comments are available.
 * Tracking macro usage.
This information is normally lost during preprocessing but it can be necessary for proper static analysis.
